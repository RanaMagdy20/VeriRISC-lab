# VeriRISC-lab
The VeriRISC model is a very-reduced-instruction-set processor coded in the Verilog HDL. Its
instruction consists of a three-bit operation code and a five-bit operand. That restricts its instruction
set to eight instructions and its address space to 32 locations. To simplify visualization and debug, it
implements the fetch-and-execute cycle in eight phases.
